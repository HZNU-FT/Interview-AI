# 1205

## 阶段任务

词向量标注和分类器

## 记录

### 12.06

#### 计划

1. 先看例子，自己执行一遍
2. 然后按照流程做以下处理：
	- 读入
		读处理完毕的词向量，标记成X_train(text), y_train(label), X_test(text), y_test(label)的形式
	- 建立模型、训练
		Embedding、卷积、池化、全连接
	- 保存、测试
		取训练集合内的句子进行测试

#### 成果

> 按行读取输入文件，直接使用Keras的`preprocessing`库处理原文本

将测试数据分为三类，可以在evaluation中得到不错的正确率

1. 通过Demo知道了textCNN的基础运行方法
2. 了解到了从两类分类到多类分类需要做的修改
	+ output类的activation function的修改（activation='softmax'）
	+ loss function的更改（loss='categorical_crossentropy'）
	+ Dense层的units数量的变化（units=3）
3. tokenizer的保存方法

> 有空可以了解一下为什么变多类需要做这些修改

#### 目标

弄清楚units数量对词向量矩阵的影响，以至于对结果的影响。

改成genism词向量的结果和字典，重新训练和测试

### 12.07

#### 成果

> 得到了一定基础上能够成功分类的分类器。

修改了`testTCNN.py`的问题形式，多个问题需要用数组表示：
```
question_origin = [	'Would you be willing to take less money ?', 
					'What are your greatest strengths ?', 
					'What other types of jobs or companies are you considering ?', 
					'Give me a summary of your current job description .', 
					'What type of position are you interested in ?']

```

得到输出结果：
```
[[0.00715799 0.00735506 0.985487  ]
 [0.0080296  0.01393266 0.9780377 ]

 [0.83761066 0.08568331 0.07670604]]
[2 2 0 1 0]
```

在训练语句的基础上进行少许改动，用变动后的问题集进行测试：
```
question_new = ['Can you introduce yourself ?', 
				'Please give me a summary of your work description .', 
				'What types of jobs are you interested in ?', 
				'Tell me about your greatest strengths .', 
				'Which course is your favorite at school ?']

 [0.06846815 0.7450809  0.18645093]]
[0 1 0 2 1]
```

#### 目标

修改输入文件，标签的输入方法按照读取文件读到的条数进行设置

修改成基于gensim的词向量输入而不是自己预处理的词向量

另外，可以看到分类器判断结果并不能达到90%以上，另外需要提高训练的文本量。


### 12.10

#### 目标

- readFile函数修改为批处理

修改读取文件函数readFile为：根据输入种类个数与不同种类输入文件内语句个数，动态地输入标签数组。

- 添加更多分类与相应的训练数据

忘记保存训练结果了，用valuate出来的结果大概是0.84左右，提高epochs对准确率的提升并不明显。

#### 成果

测试数据：
```
question_origin = [	'Would you be willing to take less money ?', 
					'What are your greatest strengths ?', 
					'What other types of jobs or companies are you considering ?', 
					'Give me a summary of your current job description .', 
					'What are your short-term objectives ?']

```

#### 总结

- 结果矩阵的可能性数字普遍偏小

由于分类很多，也能够理解这样的结果。

**需要对训练数据使用脚本进行批量测试**，查看模型对于哪些样本的判断是失误的。

并且需要记录判断结果方便日后优化。

### 12.11

#### 成果

- 获取初步测试样本的分类结果并进行记录

```

观察输出结果可以看到，就基于小样本训练数据而言，出错率最大的是分类9的“其他”类问题。
