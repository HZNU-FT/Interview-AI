Finishing a project to the best of my ability
To get a job in my field is most important to me
The general state of our economy and the impact of China¡¯ entry to WTO on our industry 
I wouldn't because the work can give me the pleasure that the leisure time can not bring
I had an excellent professional relationship with my co workers which gelled quite nicely with the company environment 
My boss would describe me as hard working loyal friendly and committed He would say that I work well on my own initiative and deliver what he wants on time and to a high standard
I made some good friends for life who today can vouch for me on a professional basis
I find that working in a team increases the work performance as well as creates a proper work flow and information distribution between team members
I prefer to work independently While working independently I realized that I was the complete owner of the project (ie one man project) and therefore considered this responsibility as an incentive/bonus
In my last postion I was part of a software implementation team We all worked together to plan and manage the implementation schedule to provide customer training and ensure a smooth transition for our customers Our team always completed our projects ahead of schedule with very positive reviews from our clients
I prefer to work in teams I find that better decisions are reached when people work together and share ideas Of course I'm happy to work alone when required too
I am an easy going person who seems to get on with everyone If I have to pick a type of person that bothers me it's the one who doesn't pull their weight or isn't worried about the standard of their work because it reflects badly on the rest of the team
I find I work well with almost everyone but who I work best with might depend on the activity If it's a project I prefer to work with someone who's practical and organized because this is important

Sometimes the narrow-minded people make me frustrated

No I¡¯m not married I¡¯m still single So I can devote more time in working
Yes sir I run a shop in this city But it doesn't influence my working energy
I can start tomorrow If you like 
I¡¯ll come here as soon as l receive my diploma and bachelor¡¯s degree certificate next month 
When I need to no problem I realize the importance of meeting deadlines and getting work done on time
There¡¯s no on-going criticism I¡¯m open to personal and professional growth and welcome the opportunity to improve
I work at a steady pace but usually complete work in advance of the deadline
I am productive enough to get the job done in a reasonable amount of time
Anger to me means loss of control I do not lose control When I get stressed I step back take a deep breath thoughtfully think through the situation and then begin to formulate a plan of action
Really nothing I¡¯ve learned from each experience I¡¯ve had
I can be flexible when it comes to my work environment
It depends on the situation and the personality of the supervisor
Even though it was difficult when Jane Doe quit without notice we were able to rearrange the department workload to cover the position until a replacement was hired
When I was working on a software implementation team at ABC Company we took over another company and had to transition many clients to a new product in a short amount of time It took a lot of planning time hard work and effort but we were able to complete the project in a timely manner
I am committed to this company and its advancement so should I not be selected I will work with and support whoever might get selected However I do feel that my experience in the department and with the team would make me the best candidate
